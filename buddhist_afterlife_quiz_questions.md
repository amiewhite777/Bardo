# BUDDHIST AFTERLIFE QUIZ: COMPLETE QUESTION BANK

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

**What the quiz measures:**
- Primary poison relationship (determines realm)
- Network topology pattern (determines subcategory)
- Specific capturing mechanism (determines form)
- Shadow material (what's denied/projected)
- Current obstacles (five hindrances state)
- Trajectory vectors (where you're heading)

**Scoring philosophy:**
- Questions load on multiple dimensions but have PRIMARY targets
- Shadow detection uses inconsistency between sections
- The SHAPE of self-deception is diagnostic data
- Speed round captures pre-reflective patterns

## SCORING SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### Primary Sort: Realm (by Dominant Poison)
- Highest Hell score → Hell Realm
- Highest HG score → Hungry Ghost Realm
- Highest Animal score → Animal Realm
- Highest Human score → Human Realm
- Highest Asura score → Asura Realm
- Highest Deva score → Deva Realm

### Secondary Sort: Subcategory (by Topology + Specific Indicators)
Within each realm, subcategory determined by:
- Specific subcategory points accumulated
- Network topology indicators
- Shadow pattern shape

### Tertiary Sort: Specific Form (by Capturing Pattern)
Within each subcategory, specific form determined by:
- Direct form indicators from questions
- Consistency patterns
- Risk vector alignment
- Shadow integration level

### Modifiers:
- SHADOW FLAGS modify interpretation (denial patterns)
- PROTECTIVE FACTORS included in result
- CONSISTENCY between sections affects confidence
- SPEED ROUND vs. CONSIDERED answers compared for shadow detection

---

## CROSS-REFERENCE SCORING

### Shadow Gap Calculation
Compare:
- Q19-21 (What you judge, what others see, what you hide)
- Q22 (Noble story)
- Q25 (Acknowledged shadow)

Large gaps = shadow territory. Small gaps = integrated shadow awareness.

### Consistency Scoring
Compare:
- Birth Realm (Section 1) vs Current Realm (Sections 2-3)
- Considered answers (Sections 2-6) vs Speed Round (Section 7)
- Self-report vs Scenario responses

Inconsistency patterns are diagnostic:
- Birth ≠ Current = life trajectory visible
- Considered ≠ Speed = shadow material
- Self-report ≠ Scenarios = self-deception pattern

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. Build scoring algorithm (next chat)
2. Calibrate weights to achieve target distribution
3. Write 62 specific form descriptions + The Instruction for each
4. Test with known cases (including Amie calibration)
5. Implement and iterate
